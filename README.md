# PRODUCT DEMAND PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

The first and foremost step in the model is collecting the data which can be done in various ways but we have already been given 
so lets move on the next step .
We have to import all the necessary libraries like pandas , numpy, matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn, decision tree etc.
We have to convert the data set file into a csv file
after importing the data we have to import the data in the model by read csv file.
the next step is converting the datas into dataframe
we further feature the data by date and time,rolling window,lag features
Then we have made sure that there are no missing values ,null and nan values and  that is taken care off.
The datas are all set for training and then moved to testing
after testing the datas are plotted and the output is acquired
after the output we have to evaluate the model ,various methods are mentioned in the file are used to evalutate the model.
Thus the model is created.
